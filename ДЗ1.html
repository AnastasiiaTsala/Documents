<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the Deuteragonist of The Simpsons.

    Bart is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child. He is the

    after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical
    Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the
